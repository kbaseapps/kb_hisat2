        short-hint : |
            Select the Assembly or Genome to align the reads.
    alignmentset_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Set Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Provide a suffix that will appended to the name of the set of reads used as input.
    alignment_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Provide a suffix that will be appended to the name of each reads library aligned.
    quality_score :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Quality Score Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the quality score type depending on the sequencing platform
        long-hint : |
            phred33 is used by Illumina starting with v1.8
    skip :
        ui-name : |
            Skip the first n reads or pairs in the input
        short-hint : |
            Skip the first n reads or pairs in the input
        long-hint : |
            Skip the first n reads or pairs in the input
    trim5 :
        ui-name : |
            Trim Bases From 5'end
        short-hint : |
            Trim the base-pairs from 5' (left) end of each read before alignment
        long-hint : |
            Trim the base-pairs from 5' end before alignment, if needed. By default, it is 0.
    trim3 :
        ui-name : |
            Trim Bases From 3'end
        short-hint : |
            Trim the base-pairs from 3' (right) end of each read before alignment
        long-hint : |
            Trim the base-pairs from 3' end before alignment, if needed. By default, it is 0.
    np :
        ui-name : |
            Penalty
        short-hint : |
            Sets the penalty for positions where the read, reference, or both, contain an ambiguous character such as N.
        long-hint : |
            By default, penalty is 1.
    min_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            HISAT2 will ignore donor/acceptor pairs closer than this many bases apart.
    max_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            HISAT2 will ignore donor/acceptor pairs farther than this many bases apart.
    no_spliced_alignment :
        ui-name : |
            Disable Splice Alignment
        short-hint : |
            HISAT2 will disable splice alignment.
    orientation :
        ui-name : |
            Orientation
        short-hint : |
            Select the upstream/downstream mate orientations for a valid paired-end alignments against the forward reference strand.
        long-hint : |
            By default, fr is used.
    reads_condition :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq reads condition
        short-hint : |
            Set the condition for the reads input. Ignored for sets of reads, required for singletons.
        long-hint : |
            Set the condition associated with the input reads object. This is required for a single sample, but ignored for sets of samples, since that is included in the set.

description : |
    <p>This App aligns the sequencing reads for a set of two or more samples to long reference sequences of a assembly or genome using HISAT2 and outputs a set of alignments for the given sample set or reads set in BAM format. If the user has only a single sample of reads, this App will take single-end or paired-end library object instead of a sample set.</p>

    <p>In addition, it outputs the Qualimap-generated BAM alignment QC report with a global summary. This summary includes the total number of mapped reads, mean samples coverage, mean samples GC-content, mean samples mapping quality, and sample statistics for each sample, along with PCA and coverage histograms.</p>

    <p>HISAT2 is essentially a successor of TopHat2 and is relatively faster and more sensitive while still maintaining low memory requirements. The HISAT2 index is based on the FM Index of Ferragina and Manzini, which in turn is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform. The algorithm used to build the index is based on the blockwise algorithm of Karkkainen.

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone for one or more RNA-seq samples.</p>
